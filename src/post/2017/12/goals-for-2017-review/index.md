**.NET Apps**

I worked a little on a GNVQ tracking app for Learning Objectives, the back end is mostly there, still working on the UI.

In general I was working on a major iOS project at work so didn't have a massive amount of spare time, learned lots of new APIs and techniques in ObjC and iOS dev which was great.
