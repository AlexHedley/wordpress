I'd started some training last year but didn't make any useful apps, I'd like to progress this to a production one in 2018.

**.NET**

I'd like to make progress in either or both of my Tracking app ideas.

**599CD**

Actually release it, I've been holding off hoping the API will be re-written, maybe I should just release, then update when it is.

Although releasing the Android at the same time would be nice.
