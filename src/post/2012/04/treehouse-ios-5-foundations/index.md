So I've finally started the [iOS5 Foundations](http://teamtreehouse.com/library/ios-5-foundations/) section and produce the code myself, always better than just watching it and assuming I'm taking it in.

Can't remember how much of  [iOS4 Foundations](http://teamtreehouse.com/library/ios-4-foundations/) I completed but a lot has changed in Xcode since they were produced and others have found it hard to follow. Might go back and re-do at some point if needed.

There's a great community on the [fb group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/164031216987291/) if help is needed.

Just working on a pun app atm.
