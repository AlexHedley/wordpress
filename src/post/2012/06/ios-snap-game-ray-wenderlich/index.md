The Snap game from [RayWenderlich.com](http://www.RayWenderlich.com) and Matthijs Hollemans is finally out and it's amazing.

Completed the first part (of 7) and it looks brilliant, a few transitions on some images for the loading screen and it just looks so professional. Simply shown and well executed, another great start to a tutorial by Matthijs Hollemans. A tip on using custom fonts will be very useful in other projects.

The cool thing about this is they have added a challenge for whoever completes it will be put in the blog post and can be seen by all,

Just completed tut 2, all was working ok, hopefully :p, can't wait until next friday.
