Finally started the iOS5 by tutorials book from the great collection of teachers on [http://www.raywenderlich.com/](http://www.raywenderlich.com/)

There are many chapters and I've been wanting to do something with a **Calendar** so I've jumped straight to there.

This chapter is by Marin Todorov [http://www.touch-code-magazine.com/](http://www.touch-code-magazine.com/) who has made some excellent tutorials, many on RW and he also has a great course on [Udemy](http://www.udemy.com/cocos2d-101-creating-a-simple-game-for-iphone-from-scratch/?couponCode=StoreOnTCM "Udemy").

Edit: Finished the Calander Chapter. Can add events to a custom calendar just for this app or add to existing calendars. This will be very useful for an app I've been thinking about making. Would like to add a calendar control to the app, and other things. Should be a good start for this though.

Next: AddressBook API, works well, nice and easy to do, when you link with the actual AddressBook library, d'oh!
