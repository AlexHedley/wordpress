So there's an updated TVML Catalog sample code project out.

Instead of having js files that make an XML file, it's just a straight XML file now. Makes much more sense to me to have it this way.

TVML Catalog: Using TVML Templates

[https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/content/samplecode/TVMLCatalog/Introduction/Intro.html#//apple\_ref/doc/uid/TP40016505-Intro-DontLinkElementID\_2](https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/content/samplecode/TVMLCatalog/Introduction/Intro.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40016505-Intro-DontLinkElementID_2)

Another thing they've changed is they suggest using Ruby instead of Python.

ruby -run -ehttpd . -p9001

I think this might  be to get around the fact videos locally didn't work with Python, I still need to test this.

In most of my previous files I was using template=".xml.js" whereas now they use documentURL=".xml" so one to check on.

I've also amended a couple of files to get video playback working, the documentcontroller.js was the place to add it.

A useful dub dub video to watch is the following.

WWDC 212 - Developing tvOS Apps Using TVMLKit: Part 1

([https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2016/212/](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2016/212/))

The video/slides do cover a basic example:

[http://devstreaming.apple.com/videos/wwdc/2016/212s41rh77qgdg26s86/212/212\_developing\_tvos\_apps\_using\_tvmlkit\_part\_1.pdf](http://devstreaming.apple.com/videos/wwdc/2016/212s41rh77qgdg26s86/212/212_developing_tvos_apps_using_tvmlkit_part_1.pdf)

// Setting up a TVMLKit JS Video Player

var video = new MediaItem('video', '[https://example.com/video.m3u8](https://example.com/video.m3u8)');

video.title = 'My Great Movie';

video.description = 'An extensive description...';

video.resumeTime = 10.0; // seconds

var playlist = new Playlist();

playlist.push(video);

var player = new Player();

player.playlist = playlist;

player.play(); // Present the player

 

The AudioVideo sample code hasn't been updated yet and there isn't an example of video playback in the above Catalog sample, the WWDC video was handy though. I like the embedded player in a lockup.
