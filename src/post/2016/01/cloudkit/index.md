I've been looking into CloudKit today and it looks really good.

The website is slick. Very easy to use and nice destination between Dev and Prod

Just watched WWDC 2015 - Session 710 CloudKit JS and Web Services

Think this is what I'll use for the bowling app.

Was looking into CoreData, already using FMDB, but syncing was an issue, do I store it in Dropbox. I needed to do more researching into CoreData and iCloud, this seems the better solution, plus I can sync to the Mac App I want to make and now make a website too.
