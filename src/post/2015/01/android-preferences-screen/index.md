I've wanted to add Preferences Screen to my app.

There's a section on Treehouse

http://teamtreehouse.com/library/android-data-persistence

Key-Value Saving with SharedPreferences

It had a lot going on and most of it was already configured

The article I found most useful was:

Added hereÂ in case the site goes.
