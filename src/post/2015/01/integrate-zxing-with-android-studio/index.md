Spent some time trying to integrate [Zxing](https://github.com/zxing/zxing/) into my app and couldn't get the Activity to work.

Lots of posts saying add this activity but the name was linked to their project so didn't work.

Do i add it in via the Project Structure, do I compile the jar using maven.

Nothing seemed to work.

I asked on the TeamTreehouse Forum and got a reply,

I think I'd come across that SO answer but as I'd been going back and forth trying everything had overlooked it.

Tried again and got it working.
