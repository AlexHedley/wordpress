I've been researching adding a done button to a NumPad and keep getting the same error:

**Can't find keyplane that supports type 4 for keyboard iPhone-PortraitChoco-NumberPad; using 2705787216\_PortraitChoco\_iPhone-Simple-Pad\_Default**

And it seems to take a lot of code.

Another option would be to add a toolbar above the keyboard.

Not sure how well this will work with [TPKeyboardAvoiding](https://github.com/michaeltyson/TPKeyboardAvoiding) but let's see, and it does!
