So I'm continuing the **Saving and Loading** data of the [RW](http://www.raywenderlich.com/tutorials) tutorials.

![](images/sqlite370_banner.gif "SQLite Logo")This time it's [SQLite3](http://www.sqlite.org/version3.html).

![](images/python-logo.gif "Python Logo")Did a little bit of [Python](http://www.python.org/) programming to so I could parse a csv into the database.

There was a few addons for python to make a graph but I had trouble getting that working, might have a go at a later date. There was versions problems.

I then hooked up the SQLite to an Xcode project and had yet further problems, I think I need to concentrate more. The code was looking up to the database and logging it in the console but it just wasn't displaying in the View for some reason.

Might as well have a go at the Core Data section and come back to SQLite again as it's good for small read only uses.
