So I've spent some of the day integrating the iTunes File Sharing and then how to Import/Export that File, also adding that option through an email.

Got an error in the iTunes File Sharing when I came to build it, don't think I added a library correctly, gonna have a look tomorrow so I've had some time away from the code.

Used the sample one to continue with the Email tutorial and that worked great!

This can be reused anyway and everywhere, can't wait to try it out.
