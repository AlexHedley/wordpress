So I was just playing about with my iPhone last night and was checking my calendar, I'd turned the phone landscape for whatever reason and the view changed to:

It got me thinking how could I have missed it for so long, I checked with a fellow iPhoner who was out and realised that his didn't do that so it must be a new feature in iOS5 :)

Checked with the [Tame Geek](http://www.tame-geek.co.uk/author/geek/)Â and the word spreads.

Of the 200 features in [iOS5](http://www.apple.com/ios/ios5/) that's one down, 199 to go!
