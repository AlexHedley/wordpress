So I recently bought the iOS Apprentice series from Ray Wenderlich's [Store](http://www.raywenderlich.com/store).

The first part is to create a Bull's Eye game. I've just completed it and very proud of the finished result. It all worked after originally deleting the view connection from the main view but that's how I learn.

Had some ideas for changes etc and see what I can come up with.

Happy coding :)
