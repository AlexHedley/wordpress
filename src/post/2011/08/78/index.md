Just had my first app published on the App Store

So I've finally got an app on the App Store :)

 

I cheated a little as I've used [http://www.appmakr.com/](http://www.appmakr.com/ "App Makr")  but it did exactly what I needed it to do, it's a quick and simple app that pulls feeds from Google Calendar, Twitter, Flickr, YouTube and has a contact form.

Once I'm better at Obj-C I'll make one myself but might as well get use out of the Developer Licence.
