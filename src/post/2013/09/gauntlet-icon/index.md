As you do while eating with your mates you have an idea for an app.

Gauntlet - send your friends a challenge.

Thought I could amend the following tut, instead of sending pics or videos that you have taken, send a pic of a Gauntlet and lay down the challenge.

Here is an Icon, WIP, I'm no designer so found the useful background from Vicki and sourced the glove elsewhere.
