I'm needing a logo/icon for my site.

I was thinking of using my initials ATH.

Do I use this overlayed like the below tweet or left to right, top to bottom, diagonally.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>RT <a href="https://twitter.com/RaptorGL">@RaptorGL</a> Help me!! Which design can you read LZA better? Design 1 <a href="https://t.co/ZtJKYE2Pf5">pic.twitter.com/ZtJKYE2Pf5</a> or Design 2 <a href="https://t.co/Ku5dwSnnav">pic.twitter.com/Ku5dwSnnav</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%231GAM&amp;src=hash">#1GAM</a>...</p>&mdash; One Game A Month (@OneGameAMonth) <a href="https://twitter.com/OneGameAMonth/statuses/354404563199066112">July 9, 2013</a></blockquote> <script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Another thing I'd seen which was quite nice was the Great Gatsby logo.

I'm no artist as you can probably tell from my site!

Do I use one of those logo sites to get one made, don't really need one but wouldn't mind paying someone to do something I clearly can't.
