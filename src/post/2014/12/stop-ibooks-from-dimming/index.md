title: "Stop iBooks from Dimming"

I'm working through a chapter of [iOS8 By Tutorials](http://www.raywenderlich.com/store/ios-8-by-tutorials "iOS By Tutorials") on iBooks on the iPad and it auto dims after a couple of minutes. Rather annoying.

Settings > General > AutoLock

Change this and it stops.
