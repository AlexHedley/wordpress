Had an issue where I created a brand new app in Xcode 6. It uses a story board with a tab bar set up. Whenever I ran it on my phone it wasn't going full screen.

I added an Default image for the splash screen and used an Image Catalog instead of the LaunchScreen.xib and it started working again.

Default-586h@2x (640 × 1136) Default@2x (640 × 960)
